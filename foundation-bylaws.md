Tact Software Foundation Bylaws
===============================

## 1. What is Open Tact Foundation

Tact Software Foundation (the “TSF”) is an association of TON developers with the aim to improve productivity of the entire TON engineering community with high quality tools.

## 2. Openness

The TSF is an open community that publishes open-source software. Any TON developer is able to participate by improving the tools and libraries, suggesting ideas and solving hard engineering problems.

## 3. Consensus

Contribution to the TSF and publication on behalf of the TSF is governed by consensus of its four founding members. 
All decisions in the TSF are subject to a 3-of-4 agreement.

Founding members are:

* [Oleg Andreev](https://github.com/oleganza)
* [Steve Korshakov](https://github.com/ex3ndr)
* [Tal Kol](https://github.com/talkol)
* [Kirill Emelyanenko](https://github.com/EmelyanenkoK)

Actions subject to consensus are listed in the appendix. Two general rules should be applied in all cases:

(a) destructive actions: any potentially irreversible or destructive action is subject to consensus;

(b) veto: whenever any founding member asks to bring an action to a consensus vote, that action should be paused until the vote happens.

## 4. Disputes

Founding members strive to resolve disputes by consensus driven by the common goal within the principles of common law.

It is preferable to strive for unanimous decisions (4-of-4) and, if it cannot be reached, to maintain the status quo until a better plan is proposed or circumstances change.

All decisions have tradeoffs and decisions by consensus are no exception. It is acceptable for a member to refuse to sign off on a decision they deem suboptimal, but accept that the TSF will move along with the decision in order to make progress. 

If the decision by consensus is a deal-breaker for one of the members, they can voluntarily leave the TSF.

In case of a standoff (2-of-4), the TSF operations halt until consensus can be reached. Neither side is permitted to use the name of the TSF to form a new organization.

## 5. Conflicts of interest

Members of TSF are expected to improve and build on top of works of TSF and not undermine its efforts by building or promoting alternatives.

The obligation to strive to achieve the goals of the organization does not apply to opportunities arising from participation in other organizations. The members of TSF are not obliged to use their position and role in other organizations to specifically promote or endorse the products of TSF.

If a founding member of TSF is building or promoting alternative tools, libraries that might be considered in direct competition to the works of TSF; or starting or joining another organization in the TON ecosystem that builds or promotes such tools, they are obliged to notify the other members. If a consensus decides there is a conflict of interest between the new organization and that member’s role within the TSF, they will need to choose whether to resign from their role in the TSF or abstain from building or promoting such tools in question.

## 6. Licensing and credits

The TSF decides the licensing requirements for the software published on its behalf by consensus. The TSF prefers permissive licenses, by default using Apache 2.0 for software and CC-BY-SA 4.0 for documentation in order to encourage adoption of its software in commercial and non-commercial settings. The choice of license in some cases may differ and must be decided by consensus.

By default, individual contributions to the TSF are individually credited and protected by copyright. The generic string “Tact Community” can be added in the copyright clause with the agreement of original contributor and by consensus of the TSF.

Software that TSF maintains, retains the original authorship in copyrights and adds “Tact Community” to the list of contributors.

Inventions of the TSF members are not assigned to the TSF if they are wholly developed on the member's own time and if they are done so without the use of TSF's equipment, supplies, facilities or trade secret information of the TSF.

## 7. Dissolution

In case of a dissolution or departure of one of the founding members, all the software remains available per its licensing terms. The parties not belonging to the TSF are not permitted to credit updates to said software to the TSF without the TSF’s decision by consensus.

## 8. Amendments

The present bylaws may be amended at any time by consensus of the founding members.

## 9. Code of conduct

Founding members of the TSF and community members are expected to behave with utter politeness and respect to each other and the entire TON community. The TSF requires excellent communication from all its members in order to achieve its goals.

If a private or public conversation went off a polite path and involves a founding member, participating parties are advised to contact Oleg Andreev or Tal Kol to moderate further discussion and mediate the disputes.
